- Logo: `public/treeline-logo.png` (already present)
- Doctor portraits:
  - `public/doctor1.jpg` (Dr. Symon Stanley)
  - `public/doctor2.jpg` (Dr. Samantha Conroy)
- Services (recommended 1200x750):
  - `public/services/preventative-diagnostic.jpg`
  - `public/services/gum-disease.jpg`

Once you drop in the files and redeploy, the site will load them automatically.
